# Weather-Dashboard

The purpse of this site was to display the data from a weather api, specifically the temperature, wind speed, and humidity for the current date as well as those three stats for the next five days, as well as be able to easily click on the previously searched cities via a button element and have the weather forecasts for those cities display upon pushing said button.
